## Project Overview

This project analyzes student behavior and performance on the **GoGymi** educational platform using a variety of machine learning techniques. We investigate multiple dimensions such as AI tutor usage, essay skill profiling, quiz performance clustering, and student disengagement prediction.

Each research question (RQ) is explored in its **own standalone notebook**, for clarity and modular access.

## Research Questions & Notebooks

- **RQ1 â†’ `rq1.ipynb`**  
  *How does usage of Gymitrainer (the AI model) relate to students' mathematics quiz performance over time?*

- **RQ2 â†’ `rq2.ipynb`**  
  *Do clusters of students based on essay skill scores exhibit distinct performance patterns in mathematics and text quizzes?*

- **RQ3 â†’ `rq3.ipynb`**  
  *How do student clusters based on their average quiz scores in each subject and total activity count differ in their engagement patterns within the platform?*

- **RQ4 â†’ `rq4.ipynb`**  
  *Can metrics of student activity predict disengagement (churn) from the platform?*
